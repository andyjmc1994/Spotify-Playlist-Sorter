# Spotify-Playlist-Sorter
Uses Spotify web API to analyse user playlists and tracks. 
Suggests the extent to which a playlist is "good fit" for an individual track 
based on a number of factors from the tracks categorisation to its musical features. 
Users can add tags to their playlists to help the algorithm better suggest the appropriate playlist for a given track
